Carrie is an artist who's very spontaneous. 
She always starts new projects and puts them on hold when she gets bored.
Unfortunately, you are her assistant.

Write a function that takes in her project list and her daily progress,
returning the list with updated progress.

Delete the ones that reached 100%.
